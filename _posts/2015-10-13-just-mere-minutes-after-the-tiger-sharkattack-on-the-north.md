title: "Just mere minutes after the tiger #sharkattack on the #northshore, a few friends and I jumped in a cage 3 miles off the coast of #Haleiwa to pay our respect to these magnificent and lethal creatures. My best wishes for a swift recovery go out to 25 year old, local surfer #colincook, who lost his left leg and a few fingertips fighting off a 13 foot #tigershark at Leftovers. #epicurrence #goepic \uD83D\uDCF7: @deezlife"
